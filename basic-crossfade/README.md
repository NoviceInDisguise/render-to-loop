# Basic Crossfade
This method is the simplest, and works well for long particle animations and footage that is abstract and does not have extremely distinct detail.

# How it Works
- Cut the footage in half
- Move the resulting strip up one channel and to the beginning frame
- Add alpha-over keyframes to create a crossfade
- Adjust the timeline to render the loop
